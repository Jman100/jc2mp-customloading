Custom Loading Screens for JC2MP
====================

A clientside script that loads base64 images and uses them to replace the loading screen in Just Cause 2 Multiplayer Mod.

Simply base64 encode the images you wish to use, and pase the strings in the images table in the script, comma separated.

Be sure to compress your images as much as possible. You don't want to send tons of data to the client on connect.
